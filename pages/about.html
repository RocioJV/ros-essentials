        Rosé Essentials was founded by five dedicated creators with a shared mission: to blend elegance, self-care, and a timeless style. 
        Our brand is deeply rooted in sustainability, beauty, and empowerment. Each product is thoughtfully designed and responsibly 
        sourced. We made it with the intention for our products not just to help you look good, but to make you feel connected to 
        something meaningful. Whether handcrafted, cruelty-free, or made from recycled materials, every item in our collection tells 
        its own unique story.
